## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge sources, enabling more informed responses beyond the model's training data. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts all without the need to retrain the model.
